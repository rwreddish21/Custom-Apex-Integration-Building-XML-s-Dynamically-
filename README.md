"# Custom-Apex-Integration-Building-XML-s-Dynamically-" 

Description:
This Apex code can be used to translate Salesforce data into different XML formats. The XML format can be customized using Custom Metadata Types. Reference the CustomMetadataStructure file to see the set up of Custom Metadata. NOTE: Each XML line should be a new record in the Custom Metadata Type.

Use Case:
Integrating with a system that requires a certain payload format, but does not leverage middleware to handle data mapping and translation.
